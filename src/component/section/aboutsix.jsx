                <p>
                  We believe that this occurrence can be primarily attributed to
                  several factors: the corrupting impact of pride and greed on
                  humanity, leading to exploitation rather than responsible
                  stewardship; a lack of understanding among God's followers
                  regarding His teachings; a failure to grasp the genuine
                  intentions and purpose of establishing God's Kingdom on Earth
                  as it is in heaven; a deficiency in recognizing one's true
                  identity and the purpose for which Father God has designed
                  them; and a tendency to lead defeated lives, passively waiting
                  for divine rescue rather than actively engaging in and
                  positively impacting all aspects of society until the day
                  Earth genuinely mirrors heaven.
